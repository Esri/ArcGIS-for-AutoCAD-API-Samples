# ArcGIS for AutoCAD API Samples

## __Introduction__
The purpose of these samples is to showcase the power of the AutoLISP API for customizing ArcGIS for AutoCAD and to inspire users to create their own custom AutoLISP code for the benefit of their own projects. 

A series of sample custom AutoLISP commands and functions are provided below, along with explanations and use case demos. 

## Samples

- [Calculate New Field](Samples/CalculateNewField/AutoLisp) \- Calculates the values of a new ArcGIS for AutoCAD attribute field by applying a mathematical expression onto the values of other fields.
- [Copy Attributes](Samples/CopyAttributes/AutoLisp)  \- Copies the ArcGIS for AutoCAD attributes from one entity and applies them to another.
- [Export Attributes To CSV](Samples/ExportAttributesToCSV/AutoLisp)  \- Exports an ArcGIS for AutoCAD feature layer's ArcGIS for AutoCAD attribute table as a CSV file.
- [Update COGO Points From Field (Civil 3D)](Samples/UpdateCOGOPointsFromField/AutoLisp)  \- Updates COGO point descriptions based on an ArcGIS for AutoCAD attribute field.
